RULES
A simplified model for the spread of a rumor goes this way: There are
N=20 people in a group of friends, of which some have heard of the
rumor and the others have not. During any single period of time, two
persons are selected at random from the group and assumed to
interact. If one of these persons has heard the rumor and the other
has not, then with a probability 0.15, the rumor is transmitted.
Assuming that this process begins at time t=0 with a single person
knowing the rumor and the first interaction occurs at time t=1, run
the system for 200 times to find average time that it takes for
everyone to hear the rumor.
